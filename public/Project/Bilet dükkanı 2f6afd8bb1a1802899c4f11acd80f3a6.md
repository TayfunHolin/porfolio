# **Bilet Dükkanı — Checkout Optimization & Purchase Flow Redesign**

**Platform:** Web · Mobile Web

**Product Type:** Travel marketplace (Flight, Bus, Hotel, Car Rental, Transfer)

**Role:** UI/UX Designer (within a product team)

**Status:** Live in production

---

## **Context**

Bilet Dükkanı is a travel commerce platform that enables users to purchase:

- Flight tickets
- Bus tickets
- Hotel reservations
- Car rentals
- Transfer services

The checkout flow is the **core revenue surface** of the product.

However, as the platform expanded with multiple verticals, the purchase experience became increasingly complex.

---

## **Problem**

The existing checkout experience had several critical issues:

- Purchase flow was **too long and fragmented**
- Users had to complete **multiple steps across separate screens**
- Inconsistent UI patterns between different travel products
- Key information (price, summary, CTA) was not always visible
- High cognitive load during the most sensitive moment: **payment**

This created friction exactly where the product needed the most confidence.

---

## **Reframing the Brief**

The initial task was framed as “UI improvements” on the purchase screens.

After analysis, the problem was reframed as:

> “The real issue isn’t visual quality — it’s flow complexity and lack of continuity.”
> 

So the focus shifted from cosmetic changes to:

- Reducing steps
- Consolidating actions into a single purchase flow
- Creating reusable checkout components
- Improving clarity and decision confidence

---

## **Solution Approach**

### **Step Reduction & Single-Flow Checkout**

The checkout was redesigned to function as a **single, continuous purchase experience** instead of multiple disconnected steps.

Key decisions:

- Minimized page transitions
- Grouped related inputs logically
- Reduced back-and-forth between screens
- Enabled users to complete the purchase in one uninterrupted flow

The goal was simple:

**less thinking, fewer interruptions, faster completion.**

---

### **Sticky Summary & Primary Action**

A **sticky right-side panel (desktop)** and **persistent bottom CTA (mobile)** were introduced.

This ensured that:

- Total price was always visible
- Purchase CTA was always accessible
- Users didn’t lose context while filling long forms

This change directly addressed hesitation and scroll fatigue.

---

### **Component-Driven Consistency**

A major part of the work focused on **design continuity**.

- The same checkout components were reused across:
    - Flight
    - Bus
    - Hotel
    - Car rental
    - Transfer flows
- Forms, input patterns, summaries, and payment blocks followed a single system
- New components were introduced only when necessary

This prevented the experience from feeling like different products stitched together.

---

## **UX Improvements in Detail**

- Clear separation of **contact, passenger, billing, and payment** information
- Improved form readability and field grouping
- Reduced visual noise during payment
- Trust signals (secure payment, providers, PCI compliance) surfaced more clearly
- Mobile experience optimized for long-form completion

Every decision was made to reduce friction at the **moment of conversion**.

---

## **Web & Mobile Alignment**

The checkout was designed simultaneously for:

- Desktop web
- Mobile web

Rather than adapting desktop designs to mobile later, layouts and components were planned to scale responsively from the start.

This ensured:

- Behavioral consistency across devices
- No “feature loss” on mobile
- Predictable interaction patterns for returning users

---

## **Handoff & Team Collaboration**

Working as a UI/UX designer within a product team:

- Components were defined clearly for reuse
- Layout logic was easy to translate into code
- Edge cases (multiple passengers, billing options, installment payments) were addressed upfront
- Design decisions were aligned with development constraints

This reduced iteration loops during implementation and helped the final output match the intended experience.

---

## **Outcome**

- Checkout flow became shorter and more predictable
- Visual and interaction consistency increased across all travel products
- Purchase experience felt more trustworthy and controlled
- Design continuity reduced user confusion between different booking types

While this project was not positioned as a “redesign,” it directly improved the **core revenue journey** of the platform.

---

## **Key Learnings (Senior-Level)**

1. Checkout UX is a flow problem, not a screen problem
2. Step reduction often matters more than visual polish
3. Consistent components build trust faster than branding
4. Sticky CTAs reduce cognitive load, not just scrolling
5. Conversion surfaces demand system thinking, not one-off design
