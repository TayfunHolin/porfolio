# **Food Waste Management Mobile App (Scan&Go) — White-Label Inventory & Expiration Control System**

**Platform:** Mobile (Android / iOS)

**Product Type:** B2B · Retail Operations · White-Label Product

**Status:** MVP completed, not yet commercially sold

**Role:** UI/UX Designer — actively involved across the end-to-end design process

**Compliance:** IFID-compliant stock control system

---

## **Context**

This product is a **mobile operational solution** designed for grocery and retail chains to **manage food waste at store level**.

The application enables stores to:

- Track products approaching expiration dates
- Take action before items become waste
- Apply discounts, route products to internal consumption or donation
- Maintain compliance with food safety and inventory regulations

From a business perspective, the product was built as a **white-label technology solution**, intended to be licensed by multiple retail chains under their own branding.

---

## **Business Problem**

Large retail chains face recurring challenges:

- High costs caused by expired products
- Manual and error-prone expiration date tracking
- Operational and regulatory pressure around food safety

Existing solutions were often:

- Fragmented across systems
- Not optimized for in-store mobile usage
- Difficult to standardize across locations

The opportunity was to create a **mobile-first, action-oriented tool** that fits directly into daily store operations.

---

## **Reframing the Problem**

The challenge went beyond inventory visibility.

It was reframed as:

> “How can we enable store employees to take fast, correct actions on expiring products with minimal training?”
> 

This reframing shifted the UX focus toward:

- Speed and clarity
- Action-driven flows
- Error prevention
- Compliance embedded into everyday workflows

---

## **Solution Overview**

The result is a **stock and expiration management system** centered around real-time, in-store actions.

Core capabilities include:

- Barcode scanning and manual barcode entry
- Category-based expiration tracking
- Clear distinction between “approaching expiration” and “expired” items
- Discount application and price recalculation
- Label generation and printing support
- Internal consumption and donation workflows

The app is designed to be used **on the shop floor**, under time pressure and operational constraints.

---

## **Key User Flows**

### **Stock Control & Expiration Tracking**

- Products are scanned via barcode
- Expiration data is retrieved automatically
- Items are grouped by urgency
- Category summaries help staff prioritize actions

This significantly reduces manual checks and operational overhead.

---

### **Action-Based UX**

The interface is designed around **decision-making**, not passive monitoring.

For each product, staff can:

- Apply a discount
- Mark for internal consumption
- Send to donation
- Flag as “product not found”

Each screen answers one core question:

**“What should I do with this product right now?”**

---

### **Discount & Labeling Flow**

- Discount percentage is selected
- New price is calculated instantly
- Label quantity is defined
- Barcode and pricing labels are generated

The entire flow is optimized to be completed **within seconds**.

---

## **White-Label & Scalability**

The product was designed as a **brand-agnostic system**:

- Easy branding and theming
- Configurable texts and workflows
- Store-level rule customization
- Consistent core UX across clients

This allows the solution to scale without redesign for each retailer.

---

## **Compliance & Risk Management**

The system was designed to be **IFID-compliant**, ensuring:

- Traceability of expiration-related actions
- Audit-ready discount and disposal records
- Reduced regulatory risk

Compliance requirements were treated as **UX constraints**, not afterthoughts.

---

## **Team Collaboration & Process**

The product was built collaboratively from the ground up.

As a UI/UX Designer:

- I actively contributed throughout the full design lifecycle
- Worked closely with product, engineering, and business teams
- Helped translate real store workflows into usable mobile flows
- Supported handoff to ensure design intent was preserved

Design decisions were driven by **operational reality**, not assumptions.

---

## **Outcome & Recognition**

- A functional, market-ready MVP for a white-label retail solution
- Clear, action-oriented mobile UX for store employees
- Simplified expiration and food waste management processes
- A scalable foundation ready for commercial rollout

In addition to the product outcomes:

- The **Scan&Go application**, to which I actively contributed during the design process,
    
    was awarded **“Startup of the Year”** at the **Mastercard PSM Awards 2025**,
    
    recognizing it as an innovative **retail-focused solution**.
    

This award validated the product not only from a UX perspective, but also in terms of **industry impact and business value**.

## **Key Learnings (Senior-Level Insights)**

1. Operational products must prioritize speed over feature depth
2. Barcode-based UX fundamentally changes user expectations
3. Compliance works best when embedded into workflows
4. White-label products require strict design discipline
5. In-store mobile UX must assume constant distraction and time pressure
