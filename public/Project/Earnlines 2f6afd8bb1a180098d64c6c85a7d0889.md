# **Earnlines — Internet Sharing & Rewards Platform**

**Platforms:** Mobile App · Web App · Web · Back Office · Landing Pages

**Product Type:** Consumer Fintech · Passive Income · Gamified Rewards

**Status:** Live

**Role:** Product Designer (UI/UX) — end-to-end design contribution

## **Context**

Earnlines is a platform that allows users to **earn money by securely sharing their unused internet bandwidth**.

In addition to passive income, the product includes **quest-based mechanics** that enable users to earn extra rewards by completing specific tasks.

The product operates as a **multi-platform ecosystem**, including:

- Consumer-facing mobile and web apps
- A web-based dashboard
- Administrative back office tools
- Marketing and acquisition-focused landing pages

---

## **Product Vision**

The core vision behind Earnlines was to create a system where:

- Earning feels **simple, transparent, and controllable**
- Passive income is complemented with **active engagement through quests**
- Users clearly understand *how much they earn, why they earn, and what affects it*

Rather than positioning earning as a “background process only,” the product balances:

- **Passive earning** (internet sharing)
- **Active earning** (quests, referrals, limits, incentives)

---

## **Design Challenges**

Key challenges included:

- Explaining a technically complex concept (internet sharing) in a trustworthy way
- Making earnings visible and predictable
- Designing motivation loops without feeling manipulative
- Maintaining consistency across many platforms and surfaces
- Supporting both short sessions (mobile) and longer analysis (web)

---

## **My Role & Ownership**

I actively contributed to the **entire design lifecycle**, including:

- Product discovery and UX exploration
- User flows and information architecture
- UI design across all platforms
- Design system alignment and component reuse
- Handoff support and implementation alignment

While working closely with the product and development teams, I ensured that the experience stayed **consistent, scalable, and user-centric** across all touchpoints.

## **Core Experience Areas**

### **Earning & Internet Sharing**

- Clear on/off control for internet sharing
- Real-time earning feedback
- Visual indicators for traffic usage and activity
- Transparent limits and earning caps

The goal was to make users feel **in control**, not monitored.

---

### **Quest System**

Quests were introduced to:

- Increase engagement beyond passive earning
- Reward intentional user actions
- Create short-term motivation loops

Quest flows were designed to be:

- Easy to understand
- Clearly rewarded
- Non-disruptive to the core earning experience

---

### **Dashboard & Analytics**

Across mobile and web:

- Earnings, traffic, and activity are clearly visualized
- Daily, weekly, and monthly breakdowns are supported
- Users can track connected devices and locations

Data hierarchy was a critical UX focus to avoid overwhelm.

---

### **Referral & Growth Mechanics**

- Invite & earn flows
- Clear reward explanations
- Easy sharing and copy mechanisms

Growth features were designed to feel **beneficial**, not aggressive.

---

## **Back Office & Admin Experience**

The back office enables:

- User and device management
- Earnings and payout monitoring
- Quest and campaign configuration
- System-level controls and reporting

Admin tools were designed with **clarity, speed, and operational efficiency** in mind.

---

## **Design System & Multi-Platform Consistency**

- Shared components across web, app, and admin panels
- Consistent interaction patterns and states
- Scalable structure for future features

This ensured that adding new earning models or quests would not break the system.

---

## **Handoff & Collaboration**

- Close collaboration with developers during implementation
- Component-based handoff
- Clear definition of states (empty, loading, active, paused, error)
- Ongoing design QA during development

This minimized UX drift between design and production.

---

## **Outcome**

- A fully designed, multi-platform earning ecosystem
- Clear and trustworthy earning experience for users
- Balanced passive and active income mechanics
- Scalable design foundation for future growth

Earnlines evolved into a **system-driven product**, not just a single app.

---

## **Key Learnings (Senior-Level Insights)**

1. Trust is the most important UX metric in earning-based products
2. Passive income needs active feedback to stay engaging
3. Gamification should support value, not distract from it
4. Multi-platform consistency reduces cognitive load
5. End-to-end design ownership prevents product fragmentation
