# GAİN — Multi-Platform OTT Experience & Design System

**Platforms:** Mobile · Tablet · Smart TV

**Scope:** End-to-end product experience, design system, handoff

**Role:** Product & UI Designer — actively involved in design and handoff

**Product Type:** Subscription-based OTT platform

---

## **Context**

GAİN is an OTT platform operating across mobile, tablet, and smart TV environments — each with fundamentally different usage contexts:

- **Mobile:** fast, personal, on-the-go consumption
- **Tablet:** relaxed, longer sessions, hybrid usage
- **TV:** lean-back, remote-driven, 10-foot experience

As the product scaled, several issues became increasingly visible:

- Inconsistent experience across platforms
- TV and tablet interfaces treated as extensions of mobile
- Complex discovery flows in a content-heavy environment
- Repeating UX complaints reflected in app store reviews

At this point, the problem was no longer purely visual —

**user trust and product perception were directly impacted.**

---

## **Reframing the Problem**

The initial brief focused on UI improvements.

However, after analysis, the real problem was reframed as:

> “GAİN doesn’t need more screens — it needs a platform-aware, consistent experience system.”
> 

This reframing shifted the work from a UI refresh to:

- Multi-platform experience design
- A scalable, shared design system
- UX decisions tied directly to user satisfaction and ratings

---

## **Solution Approach**

### **Mobile Experience — Speed & Personalization**

Mobile is the most personal touchpoint of the product.

Design priorities:

- Simplified discovery flows
- Clear hierarchy of primary actions (watch, continue, save)
- Dark-first design for extended usage
- One-hand usability and short attention spans

**Goal:** reduce friction and help users reach content faster.

---

### **Tablet Experience — Comfort & Immersion**

Tablet usage sits between mobile and TV but requires its own logic.

Key decisions:

- Wider grid systems and higher information density
- Richer content detail pages
- Touch-first interactions preserved
- Clear separation from “scaled-up mobile” thinking

Tablet was treated as a **distinct experience**, not a breakpoint.

---

### **TV Experience — Lean-Back & Remote-First**

TV introduced a completely different UX problem.

Design considerations:

- Focus-based navigation as a core system feature
- Explicit focus, selected, and hover states
- Reduced text density, increased visual emphasis
- Remote-friendly interaction patterns

**Goal:** content consumption without cognitive load —

the user should never “think about the remote.”

---

## **Design System — Platform-Aware Foundations**

The design system became the backbone of the project.

### **Color & Tokens**

- Dark-mode-first semantic token structure
- Higher contrast variants optimized for TV
- Shared foundations, platform-specific adaptations

### **Typography**

- Responsive type scale across mobile, tablet, and TV
- Larger sizes and increased line height for 10-foot viewing
- Readability prioritized over visual flourish

---

## **Components & Reusability**

Components were designed around **usage context**, not screens.

- Buttons adapted for touch and remote interaction
- Content cards scaled across platforms with flexible density
- Navigation patterns diverged where necessary
- Focus, loading, empty, and error states defined upfront

This approach allowed:

- Faster iteration
- Reduced design debt
- Consistent UI behavior across teams and platforms

---

## **Handoff & Implementation**

Multi-platform delivery made handoff critical.

- Platform-specific component usage documented
- Focus order and navigation rules clearly defined for TV
- iOS, Android, and TV differences resolved at design stage
- Design system served as a single source of truth

As a result:

- Fewer design clarifications during development
- UI consistency preserved in production
- Reduced friction between design and engineering

---

## **Outcome & Measurable Impact**

This work went beyond visual quality and directly affected user perception.

- **App store rating increased from 2.1 → 4.3**
- User reviews highlighted improved usability and clarity
- Cross-platform experience felt more reliable and cohesive
- GAİN shifted away from the “great content, hard to use” perception

This rating increase became a clear validation of the UX decisions made throughout the project.

---

## **Key Learnings (Senior-Level Insights)**

1. In OTT products, the real problem is rarely content — it’s hierarchy
2. Tablet is not a larger mobile screen
3. TV UX is primarily a navigation problem, not a UI problem
4. Design systems don’t hide platform differences — they manage them
5. Good handoff is what allows design decisions to show up in metrics

### **Optional Short Portfolio Line**

> Redesigned GAİN’s multi-platform OTT experience and design system, contributing to an increase in app store rating from 2.1 to 4.3.
