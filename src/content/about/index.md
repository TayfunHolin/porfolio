# Beyond Design
title: Beyond Design

When I'm not designing beautiful interfaces, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading about design trends, or working on personal creative projects. I've always had a passion for creating and tinkering with things, which is what drew me to the world of UI/UX design.

I'm also a big advocate for open-source software and tools. I believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or financial means.
