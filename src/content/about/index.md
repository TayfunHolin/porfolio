# Bio

Hello, I’m a UI/UX Designer based in Istanbul, with 4+ years of experience designing digital products across a wide range of industries, including e-commerce, OTT platforms, Web3 & cryptocurrency, metaverse, travel, back-office systems, and mobile applications.

I have a basic working knowledge of HTML and CSS, and I built this website myself using Vibe Coding, which allows me to design with a stronger understanding of development constraints and handoff processes.

I specialize in building scalable, multi-brand design systems and robust design token structures that ensure consistency across platforms and products. Throughout my entire design process, I actively use AI-powered tools for research, ideation, validation, and iteration. By combining a user-centered design approach with strong product thinking, I create digital experiences that balance usability, scalability, and visual quality.

# Beyond Design
title: Beyond Design

When I'm not designing beautiful interfaces, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading about design trends, or working on personal creative projects. I've always had a passion for creating and tinkering with things, which is what drew me to the world of UI/UX design.

I'm also a big advocate for open-source software and tools. I believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or financial means.
