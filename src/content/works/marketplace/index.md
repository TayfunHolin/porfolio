**Platform:** Web

**Product Type:** Web3 Marketplace → Web3 Platform

**Status:** Live in production

**Role:** Lead UI/UX Designer — owned the end-to-end design process

---

## Context

GoArt Worlds Marketplace initially started as a **Web3 NFT marketplace**, focused on browsing, collecting, and trading digital assets.

As the product evolved, its scope expanded rapidly into a **full Web3 platform**, enabling users to:

- Manage wallets and portfolios
- Buy and exchange tokens
- Participate in staking
- Claim rewards and airdrops
- Track leaderboard positions
- Engage in referral and earn mechanics
- Interact with ERC-721 and ERC-1155 assets
- Access news, quests, and community tools

This evolution required a fundamental shift from **marketplace UX** to **platform-level system design**.

---

## Product Challenge

The main challenge was scale — not just in features, but in **mental load**.

Key problems:

- Marketplace UX breaking under platform complexity
- Web3 concepts unfamiliar to non-crypto-native users
- Increasing number of financial and irreversible actions
- Need for trust, clarity, and safety in every interaction

> It had become a multi-functional Web3 operating system for users.

---

## Reframing the Problem

The reframed problem became:

> "How do we design a Web3 platform that feels powerful for experienced users, but still understandable and safe for newcomers?"

This reframing shifted the design focus to:

- Strong information architecture
- Progressive disclosure of Web3 complexity
- Clear separation between exploration and transaction
- Consistent interaction patterns across all modules

As features increased, navigation became a critical UX problem.

- A redesigned sidebar optimized for scalability
- Clear separation between exploration, asset management, and transactions
- Predictable page hierarchy across the platform

Users always know: where they are, what actions are safe, and what actions carry risk.

---

## Trust, Safety & Error Handling

In Web3 products, UX is directly tied to **financial trust**.

- Clear error states and empty states
- Explicit confirmations for critical actions
- Visual distinction between read-only and destructive actions
