**Platform:** Web (Back Office / Admin Panel)

**Product Type:** Internal tool & brand management platform for a Web3 product

**Status:** Live in production

**Role:** UI/UX Designer — involved in all design and handoff processes

---

## Context

GoArt Worlds operates not only as a user-facing mobile application, but also as a **complex Web3 ecosystem** that requires full operational control behind the scenes.

The **Back Office** serves as the central control layer where:

- All in-app actions are configured and managed
- Content, rewards, and campaigns are created and published
- User activity and moderation are handled
- Web3-related mechanics are controlled safely
- Brand partners manage their own portals

---

## Product Challenge

The GoArt Worlds Back Office is not a simple admin panel. It is a **multi-role, multi-permission, multi-module system** supporting both internal teams and external brand partners.

Core modules include:

- User & role management
- Virtual Space & AR Space configuration
- Quest, game, and reward systems
- Airdrop, campaign, and loyalty mechanics
- Leaderboards, level rewards, and referrals
- Inventory, produced items, and IAP management
- Brand portals for partnerships
- Moderation, reports, and feedback
- Push notifications & email marketing
- Localization, app configuration, and admin tools

> How do we design a highly powerful system that remains safe, understandable, and scalable for very different user roles?

## Design Approach

### Role-Based UX & Permissions

The entire experience was designed around **role-based access control**.

User roles included: Admin, Moderator, Brand Manager, Operations / Content roles.

For each role, visible pages, allowed actions, edit, publish, and approval rights were clearly defined. Users only see what they are authorized to see — improving both **security and usability**.

### Modular & Scalable Information Architecture

Navigation and page hierarchy were designed to be:

- Responsibility-driven rather than feature-driven
- Modular and extensible
- Resistant to future feature growth

### Brand Portal & Partnership Management

- Dedicated brand portals were designed
- Brands could manage their own campaigns, rewards, and content
- Clear permission boundaries prevented unsafe actions

### High-Risk Actions & Safe UX Patterns

Since many actions affect the live product:

- Confirmation steps were added
- Warning and context messages were clearly surfaced
- Irreversible actions included extra safety layers
