**Platform:** Web · Responsive

**Product Type:** AI Platform · SaaS · Multi-Tool System

**Status:** Live

**Role:** Lead UI/UX Designer — owned and led the design process end-to-end

---

## Context

Kloudser is a web-based platform that brings together **multiple AI-powered tools** under a single, unified product experience.

The platform enables users to work with:

- AI image generation
- AI text generation
- Text-to-speech
- Translation
- Prompt-based creative tools
- Asset management and history tracking

Rather than offering isolated tools, Kloudser positions itself as a **central workspace for AI-driven creation**.

---

## Product Challenge

The core challenge was **complexity management**.

- Multiple AI tools with very different interaction models
- High cognitive load caused by prompt-based workflows
- Need for consistency across tools without limiting flexibility
- Requirement for a responsive experience across screen sizes

The risk was turning the platform into a collection of disconnected features instead of a coherent product.

---

## Reframing the Problem

The problem was reframed from "designing AI tools" to:

> "How do we design a system where different AI capabilities feel like parts of one product, not separate applications?"

---

## Design Approach

### System-First UX

The platform was designed as a **modular system**:

- Shared navigation and layout structure
- Consistent sidebar and workspace patterns
- Reusable components across all AI tools
- Common states (empty, loading, error, success)

### AI Image & Text Generators

- Prompt-driven interfaces optimized for clarity
- Visual separation between input, generation, and output
- History and version awareness to support iteration
- Clear feedback during processing states

### Tool Navigation & Workspace

- Sidebar-based navigation for fast tool switching
- Workspace layouts that adapt to content density
- Clear hierarchy between actions and results

### Asset & Output Management

- Generated content is easily accessible
- Consistent preview patterns across formats
- Clear ownership of outputs per tool

---

## Responsive Design

Kloudser was designed with **responsive behavior in mind** from the start. Layouts adapt across desktop and smaller screens, navigation collapses gracefully, and core workflows remain usable on all viewports.

---

## Outcome

- A unified AI platform housing multiple tools under one UX system
- Reduced cognitive load across complex AI workflows
- Scalable foundation for adding new AI capabilities
- A clear product identity beyond individual AI features
