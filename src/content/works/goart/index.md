**Platform:** Mobile (iOS / Android)

**Product Type:** Web3 / Blockchain-based social & earn platform

**Status:** Live in production

**Role:** UI/UX Designer (worked collaboratively within the product team)

## Context

GoArt Worlds is a Web3-enabled mobile platform where users:

- Create and customize their own avatars
- Interact with other users in a shared digital world
- Complete quests and seasonal challenges
- Earn rewards through blockchain-based mechanics
- Combine digital and physical worlds via AR experiences

The product blends **social interaction, gamification, Web3 economy, and mobile UX** into a single ecosystem.

---

## Product Challenge

GoArt Worlds is not a single-feature app — it is a **multi-layered system** with many parallel flows:

- Authentication & onboarding
- Avatar creation and customization
- Daily bonus & reward systems
- Quests, season quests, and leaderboards
- Airdrops and referral mechanics
- Inventory, wallet, and crafting flows
- AR-based on-location experiences
- In-app purchases and Web3 transactions

The main challenge was **designing clarity and continuity** inside a highly complex Web3 product without overwhelming users.

---

## Reframing the Problem

The core UX problem was not the number of features, but how they **coexisted**.

The challenge was reframed as:

> "How do we make a complex Web3 system feel understandable, engaging, and usable on mobile?"

This required:

- Strong information architecture
- Clear mental models for users unfamiliar with Web3
- Consistent components across very different feature sets
- A balance between game-like immersion and transactional clarity

### Feature-Rich, System-Driven UX

Instead of treating each feature as a standalone screen, the product was approached as a **connected system**.

Key principles:

- Reusable UI patterns across different flows
- Familiar mobile interaction models layered onto Web3 concepts
- Gradual exposure to complexity (progressive disclosure)
- Visual hierarchy that prioritizes action and rewards

### Avatar, Identity & Social Presence

Avatar creation and customization were central to user identity.

- Clear visual feedback for customization choices
- Strong connection between avatar, inventory, and rewards
- Social visibility through leaderboards and shared spaces

### Quests, Rewards & Progression

Multiple reward-driven systems were unified through a consistent UX language:

- Daily bonuses
- Season quests
- Airdrops
- Leaderboards

### Inventory, Wallet & Crafting

Web3 concepts like wallets and digital assets were translated into **mobile-friendly mental models**.

- Inventory-first thinking instead of blockchain-first terminology
- Clear ownership and value representation
- Crafting workshop flows designed as guided, step-by-step actions
- Wallet interactions simplified to reduce perceived risk

### AR On-Location Experiences

AR features introduced real-world interaction into the product.

- Clear entry points into AR flows
- Contextual guidance during on-location tasks
- Smooth transitions between physical and digital experiences
