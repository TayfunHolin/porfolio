**Platform:** Web · Mobile Web

**Product Type:** Travel marketplace (Flight, Bus, Hotel, Car Rental, Transfer)

**Role:** UI/UX Designer (within a product team)

**Status:** Live in production

## Context

Bilet Dukkani is a travel commerce platform that enables users to purchase flight tickets, bus tickets, hotel reservations, car rentals, and transfer services.

The checkout flow is the **core revenue surface** of the product. However, as the platform expanded with multiple verticals, the purchase experience became increasingly complex.

---

## Problem

The existing checkout experience had several critical issues:

- Purchase flow was **too long and fragmented**
- Users had to complete **multiple steps across separate screens**
- Inconsistent UI patterns between different travel products
- Key information (price, summary, CTA) was not always visible
- High cognitive load during the most sensitive moment: **payment**

---

## Reframing the Brief

After analysis, the problem was reframed as:

> "The real issue isn't visual quality — it's flow complexity and lack of continuity."

The focus shifted from cosmetic changes to reducing steps, consolidating actions into a single purchase flow, creating reusable checkout components, and improving clarity and decision confidence.

## Solution Approach

### Step Reduction & Single-Flow Checkout

The checkout was redesigned to function as a **single, continuous purchase experience** instead of multiple disconnected steps.

- Minimized page transitions
- Grouped related inputs logically
- Reduced back-and-forth between screens

**Less thinking, fewer interruptions, faster completion.**

### Sticky Summary & Primary Action

A **sticky right-side panel (desktop)** and **persistent bottom CTA (mobile)** were introduced.

- Total price was always visible
- Purchase CTA was always accessible
- Users didn't lose context while filling long forms

### Component-Driven Consistency

The same checkout components were reused across flight, bus, hotel, car rental, and transfer flows. Forms, input patterns, summaries, and payment blocks followed a single system.

---

## UX Improvements in Detail

- Clear separation of contact, passenger, billing, and payment information
- Improved form readability and field grouping
- Trust signals (secure payment, providers, PCI compliance) surfaced more clearly
- Mobile experience optimized for long-form completion

---

## Outcome

- Checkout flow became shorter and more predictable
- Visual and interaction consistency increased across all travel products
- Purchase experience felt more trustworthy and controlled
- Design continuity reduced user confusion between different booking types
