## Context

This product is a **mobile operational solution** designed for grocery and retail chains to **manage food waste at store level**.

The application enables stores to:

- Track products approaching expiration dates
- Take action before items become waste
- Apply discounts, route products to internal consumption or donation
- Maintain compliance with food safety and inventory regulations

From a business perspective, the product was built as a **white-label technology solution**, intended to be licensed by multiple retail chains under their own branding.

---

## Business Problem

Large retail chains face recurring challenges:

- High costs caused by expired products
- Manual and error-prone expiration date tracking
- Operational and regulatory pressure around food safety

The opportunity was to create a **mobile-first, action-oriented tool** that fits directly into daily store operations.

---

## Reframing the Problem

> "How can we enable store employees to take fast, correct actions on expiring products with minimal training?"

This reframing shifted the UX focus toward speed and clarity, action-driven flows, error prevention, and compliance embedded into everyday workflows.

---

## Key User Flows

### Stock Control & Expiration Tracking

- Products are scanned via barcode
- Expiration data is retrieved automatically
- Items are grouped by urgency
- Category summaries help staff prioritize actions

### Action-Based UX

The interface is designed around **decision-making**, not passive monitoring.

For each product, staff can apply a discount, mark for internal consumption, send to donation, or flag as "product not found."

Each screen answers one core question: **"What should I do with this product right now?"**

### Discount & Labeling Flow

- Discount percentage is selected
- New price is calculated instantly
- Label quantity is defined
- Barcode and pricing labels are generated

The entire flow is optimized to be completed **within seconds**.

---

## White-Label & Scalability

The product was designed as a **brand-agnostic system** with easy branding, configurable texts and workflows, and store-level rule customization.

---

## Outcome & Recognition

- A functional, market-ready MVP for a white-label retail solution
- Clear, action-oriented mobile UX for store employees
- Simplified expiration and food waste management processes

The **Scan&Go application** was awarded **"Startup of the Year"** at the **Mastercard PSM Awards 2025**.
